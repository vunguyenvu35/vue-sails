# > Files to exclude from your app's repo.
#
# This file (`.gitignore`) is only relevant if
# you are using git.
#
# It exists to signify to git that certain files
# and/or directories should be ignored for the
# purposes of version control.
#
# This keeps tmp files and sensitive credentials
# from being uploaded to  your repository.  And
# it allows you to configure your app for your
# machine without accidentally committing settings
# which will smash the local settings of other
# developers on your team.
#
# Some reasonable defaults are included below,
# but, of course, you should modify/extend/prune
# to fit your needs!

# Local Configuration
#
# Explicitly ignore files which contain:
#
# 1. Sensitive information you'd rather not push to
#    your git repository.
#    e.g., your personal API keys or passwords.
#
# 2. Developer-specific configuration
#    Basically, anything that would be annoying
#    to have to change every time you do a
#    `git pull` on your laptop.
#    e.g. your local development database, or
#    the S3 bucket you're using for file uploads
#    during development.
